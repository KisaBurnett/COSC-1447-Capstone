# COSC-1447-Capstone
Hangman game written in C++ for COSC-1437 Programming II capstone project at Northwest Vista College, Spring 2021.

The game begins with the program randomly selecting a word from a predined dictionary, then displays spaces for the number of letters in the word, and an empty gallows made of symbols.

The player must guess the word one letter at the time, with feedback from the computer relaying if the guess is correct, incorrect, or already guessed. If the letter exists in the word, the letter is displayed in correct blank spaces to give further hints to the player. If the letter does not exist in the word, another body part of the hanged man is added to the illustrated gallows.

If the hanged man's body is completed, the game is over and the player loses. If the player correctly guesses all the letters in the word, the player wins.

Repo includes unzipped project files, as well as an archive .zip for easy download and extraction.
